                    <h2>About Me</h2>
                    <p>I'm Caliber (Dylan), a 16-year-old (turning 17 soon) community management professional with over 3 years of experience working in and leading communities, mainly within Minecraft and Discord environments.</p>
                    <p>The roles that I have had the chance to work as have ranged from beginner staff positions all the way up to management and development, giving me the opportunity to understand server administration, moderation, and structure organization. I take pride in joining teams and servers that have a lot of organization because I struggled with organizing for the longest time, and now that I am fairly good at it, I love seeing other people doing the same.</p>
                    <p>I'm passionate about helping communities grow while creating positive experiences for members. I have learned how important it is for staff to be calm, professional, and take accountability when handling situations. I don't see staff positions as ranks or status symbols I see them as opportunities to help servers thrive and create positive impacts.</p>

                        <h3>Moderation</h3>
                        <p class="project-description">I began my staffing career as a Moderator, where I learned the importance of being professional and having fairness within the community. I constantly maintained chat safety, handled community disputes, and ensured rules were followed. I've developed a strong ability to stay calm under pressure, gather accurate evidence before making decisions, and prioritize issues effectively handling immediate threats like harassment before addressing localized problems. I treat all players equally, regardless of personal relationships, and never let emotions influence my moderation decisions.</p>

                        <p class="project-description">When I was granted a Manager position and later a Head Administrator, I took on more responsibility in handling operations and guiding staff. My leadership focuses on structure, accountability, and teamwork. I've created staff handbooks, conducted performance check-ins, and coordinated tasks across teams. I excel at documentation, running staff meetings, and maintaining clear communication channels. I understand that good leadership means holding everyone including myself to the same standards and creating an environment where staff can grow and improve through constructive feedback.</p>

I'm proficient in using commands like /gmsp, /logs, and /invsee for monitoring, and I can record evidence at reasonable frame rates and quality. I work on plugin configuration, backend optimization, and cross-team coordination to ensure technical implementations align with community needs.</p>

                        <p class="project-description">Beyond staffing and development, I have grown a strong set of communication and writing skills. I have the ability to communicate clearly and adapt to different tones, which makes me a great asset in any team. I excel at creating professional documents, public announcements, detailed meeting reports, and adapting my communication style to fit the situation—whether explaining rules to new players, documenting evidence for management, or coordinating with staff teams. I can record videos for promotion and handle customer-facing communications with professionalism.</p>

                        <h3>Fairness & Accountability</h3>
                        <p>I enforce rules consistently for everyone—friends, strangers, or people I may not like. No one is above the rules, including staff members. I take accountability for my actions and document everything transparently.</p>

                        <h3>Evidence-Based Decisions</h3>
                        <p>I never rush to judgment. I gather proof through screenshots, videos, and logs before making any decision. False bans damage server reputation, so I prioritize accuracy over speed while still acting efficiently.</p>

                        <h3>Priority Management</h3>
                        <p>I assess situations critically. Global issues like harassment get immediate attention before localized problems. I can handle multiple crises simultaneously while staying calm and organized.</p>

                        <p>Whether facing personal attacks, staff abuse, or server raids, I maintain professionalism. I don't let emotions drive my decisions and always focus on protecting the community first.</p>

                        <p>I take feedback seriously and constantly work to improve. I'm not perfect, but I learn from every mistake. My goal is always to become better at serving the community.</p>

                        <h3>Community First</h3>
                        <p>I don't apply for ranks or status—I apply to help communities thrive. I genuinely care about creating positive environments where players feel safe, supported, and heard.</p>
