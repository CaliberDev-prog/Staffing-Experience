Hi Guys! 

My name is Caliber, I am a young developer, and gamer that loves making peoples life's easier, but also helping out whenever I can. 

I love working on new projects, and new things I take pride in my work and I try my best to do things as quick as possible so that it can be delivered to the client or customer no matter the deadline, 

If you look on my portfolio, aka my Staffing-Experience, you will see that I have worked and owned a lot of server, and I would be glad to put your server on that list! 

If you have any questions or concerns, you can reach me at discord or email via the information before.
